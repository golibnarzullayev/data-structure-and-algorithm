# Product Except Self Algorithm

This algorithm computes the product of all elements in a list except for the element at each index. The algorithm should work in O(n) time complexity, and it should not use the division (/) operator.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, for each element in the array, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

### Example

#### Input:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4];
```

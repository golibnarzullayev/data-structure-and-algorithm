# Reverse String Algorithm

This algorithm reverses a given list of characters in place with O(1) space complexity. The reversal is done by swapping characters from both ends towards the center.

## Problem Description

Given an array of characters, reverse the characters in place such that the first character becomes the last, the second character becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

### Example

#### Input:

```js
["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"];
```
